# Proptech
I am currently an analyst at a proptech company that wants to offer an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. The company wants to have a trial of this offering in the San Francisco real-estate market. If the service proves popular, they can then expand to other markets.

I utilized my data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.

Final Analysis: 
The analysis shows that San Francisco could be the perfect city to implement the one-click buy and rent strategy as in most neighborhoods the property values (sale price) do increase generally speaking but more importantly if the investor buys and rents the property over a long period of time the rental income growth consitently increases year over year in all SF neighborhoods. The prime neighborhood for this investment strategy would be Union Square District at both sale prices and rents have been increase substanitally from 2010 to 2016. In addition, other neighborhoods that show promise for this investment strategy would be Westwood Park, Miraloma Park and Merced to name a few that show consistant and upwards growth in both sale price and rental income from 2010 to 2016.
